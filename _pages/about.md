I am a first year PhD student in the [SSA group](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/ssa/) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in Paris.
I conduct my PhD under the supervision of [Giovanna Varni](https://sites.google.com/site/gvarnisite/home) (Télécom Paris). I am working on TO DO. I held a MSc in XXX from [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) (U.K.) and an engineering degree from [ESTIA](https://www.estia.fr/) (France). <br>
Prior to my PhD I worked at [Grabyo](https://about.grabyo.com/) as a video engineer + to finish.
