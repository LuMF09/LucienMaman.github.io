<span style="color: #DC3522">Abo</span>ut me
------
<p align="justify">I am a first year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/ssa/" target="_blank">SSA</a> group (Signal, Statistique et Apprentissage) at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/" target="_blank">Télécom Paris</a> in Paris.
My PhD research work is under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5buL2cAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Laurence Linkforman-Sulem</a> (Télécom Paris) and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gvarnisite/home" target="_blank">Giovanna Varni</a> (Télécom Paris). The scope of my research encompasses the automatic detection of cohesion in small groups of humans. One of my drivers for innovation is the search of integration of multi-disciplinary approach when it comes to design and develop new experiments and applications.<br> 
Prior to my PhD, I worked at <a href="https://about.grabyo.com/" target="_blank">Grabyo</a> as a video engineer where I had the chance to work with amazing people and to enrich my technical and managing skills.<br>
I also hold a MSc in Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering from <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cranfield University</a> (U.K.) and an engineering degree from <a href="https://www.estia.fr/" target="_blank">ESTIA</a> (France).<br><br>

On a different note, I am also a rugby player. TO finish.</p>
