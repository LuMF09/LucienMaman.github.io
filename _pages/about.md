<span style="color: #DC3522">Abo</span>ut me
------
<p align="justify">I am a third-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/laboratories/information-processing-and-communication-laboratory-ltci/research-teams/signal-statistics-learning" target="_blank">Signal, Statistics and Learning</a> (S2A) team in the <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal" target="_blank">Image, Data and Signal</a> (IDS) Department of the <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/laboratories/information-processing-and-communication-laboratory-ltci" target="_blank">Laboratory Treatment and Communication of Information</a> (LTCI) at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home" target="_blank">Télécom Paris</a>, Paris.
My PhD research work is under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7AM4CZIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Giovanna Varni</a> (Télécom Paris), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5buL2cAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Laurence Linkforman-Sulem</a> (Télécom Paris) and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=AKdzMWUAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Mohamed Chetouani</a> (ISIR-UPMC, CNRS). The scope of my research encompasses the automatic detection of cohesion in small groups of humans. One of my drivers for innovation is the search for integration of a multi-disciplinary approach when it comes to the design and development of new experiments and applications.<br> 
Prior to my PhD, I worked at <a href="https://about.grabyo.com/" target="_blank">Grabyo</a> as a video engineer where I had the chance to work with top engineers and to enrich my technical and managing skills.<br>
I also hold an MSc in Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering from <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cranfield University</a> (U.K.) and an engineering degree from <a href="https://www.estia.fr/" target="_blank">ESTIA</a> (France).</p>
 
<span style="color: #DC3522">On a </span>different note
------
<p align="justify">I am also a rugby player. I played semi-professionally and professionally in France (Montpellier and Biarritz), in the U.K. (Richmond), in Australia (Gold Coast) and at international level, playing for Algeria. I am now playing at an amateur level in Paris (P.U.C).<br>
I am playing scrum-half (not scrum master), a key role where I have to lead the other players to adhere to the team strategy. I love being on the pitch for the adrenaline and fun it procures and off the pitch for the spirit and the friendships developed around rugby.<br>
I am also a music enthusiast. I am mainly playing piano and exploring GarageBand to create my electronic songs.</p>

<span style="color: #DC3522">Con</span>tact
------
<p align="justify">I am always excited to discuss new projects and ideas and I am open for collaboration!<br>
You can also follow the latest updates of my research on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucien-maman/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LucienMaman09" target="_blank">Twitter</a> accounts.</p>
