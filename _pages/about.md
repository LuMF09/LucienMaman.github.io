<span style="color: #DC3522">Abo</span>ut me
------
<p align="justify">I am a first year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/ssa/" target="_blank">SSA group</a> at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/" target="_blank">Télécom Paris</a> in Paris.
I conduct my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5buL2cAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Laurence Linkforman-Sulem</a> (Télécom Paris) and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gvarnisite/home" target="_blank">Giovanna Varni</a> (Télécom Paris). My research mainly focuses on the automatic detection of cohesion in small groups' interactions. I am constantly trying to integrate a multi-disciplinary approach when designing and developing new experiments and applications as I strongly believe that it is the key to innovate.<br> 
Prior to my PhD, I worked at <a href="https://about.grabyo.com/" target="_blank">Grabyo</a> as a video engineer where I had the chance to work with amazing people and to enrich my technical and managing skills.<br>
I also held a MSc in Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering from <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cranfield University</a> (U.K.) and an engineering degree from <a href="https://www.estia.fr/" target="_blank">ESTIA</a> (France).<br><br>

On a different note, I am also a rugby player. TO finish.
