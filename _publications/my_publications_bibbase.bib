abstract = { Supervised learning relies on the availability and reliability of the labels used to train computational models. 
In research areas such as Affective Computing and Social Signal Processing, such labels are usually extracted from multiple self- and/or external assessments. 
Labels are, then, either aggregated to produce a single groundtruth label, or all used during training, potentially resulting in degrading performance of the models. 
Defining a true label is, however, complex. 
Labels can be gathered at different times, with different tools, and may contain biases. 
Furthermore, multiple assessments are usually available for a same sample with potential contradictions. 
Thus, it is crucial to devise strategies that can take advantage of both self- and external assessments to train computational models without a reliable groundtruth. 
In this study, we designed and tested 3 of such strategies with the aim of mitigating the biases and making the models more robust to uncertain labels. 
Results show that the strategy based on weighting the loss during training according to a measure of disagreement improved the performances of the baseline, hence, underlining the potential of such an approach.},

abstract = { Emergent states are behavioral, cognitive and affective processes appearing among
the members of a group when they interact together. In the last decade, the development
of computational approaches received a growing interest in building Human-Centered
systems. Such a development is particularly difficult because some of these states
have several dimensions interplaying somehow and somewhere over time. In this paper,
we focus on cohesion, its dimensions and their interplay. Several definitions of cohesion
exist, it can be simply defined as the tendency of a group to stick together to pursue
goals and/or affective needs. This plethora of definitions resulted in many different
cohesion dimensions. Social and Task dimensions are the most investigated both in
Social Sciences and Computer Science since they both play an important role in a wide
range of contexts and groups. To the best of our knowledge, however, no previous work
on the prediction of cohesion dynamics focused on how these 2 dimensions interplay.
We leverage Social Sciences to address this issue. In particular, we take advantage
of the importance of Social cohesion for creating flexible and constructive relationships
to reinforce Task cohesion. We describe a Deep Neural Network architecture (DNN) for
predicting the dynamics of Task cohesion by applying transfer learning from a pre-trained
model dedicated to the prediction of Social cohesion dynamics. Our architecture is
evaluated against several baselines. Results show that it significantly improves the
predictions of the Task cohesion dynamics, confirming the benefits of integrating
Social Sciences insights into models architectures.},

 abstract = {Leadership is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that has received a lot of attention from psychologists over the last 50 years, primarily due to its relationships with team effectiveness and performances. Depending on the group (e.g., size, relationships among members) and the context (e.g., solving a task under pressure), various styles of leadership could emerge. These styles can either be formally decided or manifest informally. Among the informal types of leadership, emergent leadership is one of the most studied. It is an emergent state that develops over time in a group and that interplays with other emergent states such as cohesion. Only a few computational studies focusing on predicting emergent leadership take advantage of the relationships with other phenomena to improve their models’ performances. These approaches, however, only apply to their models aimed at predicting emergent leadership. There is, to the best of our knowledge, no approach that integrates emergent leadership into computational models of cohesion. In this study, we take a first step towards bridging this gap by introducing 2 families of approaches inspired by Social Sciences’ insights to integrate emergent leadership into computational models of cohesion. The first family consists of amplifying the differences between leaders’ and followers’ features while the second one focuses on adding leadership representation directly into the computational model’s architecture. In particular, for each family, we describe 2 approaches that are applied to a Deep Neural Network model aimed at predicting the dynamics of cohesion across various tasks over time. This study explores whether and how applying our approaches improves the prediction of the dynamics of the Social and Task dimensions of cohesion. Therefore, the performance of a computational model of cohesion that does not integrate the interplay between cohesion and emergent leadership is compared with the same computational models that apply our approaches. Results show that approaches from both families significantly improved the prediction of the Task cohesion dynamics, confirming the benefits of integrating emergent leadership following Social Psychology’s insights to enforce computational models of cohesion at both feature and architecture levels.},

 abstract={Cohesion is an affective group phenomenon. It has received a lot of attention from scholars both in Social Sciences and in Affective Computing that showed that cohesion and emotion influence each other, highlighting the need to jointly analyze them. This study presents 2 deep neural network architectures grounded on multitask learning to jointly predict cohesion and emotion. Inspired by 2 major Social Sciences approaches on group emotion (i.e., Top-down and Bottom-up), these architectures exploit cohesion and emotion interdependencies intending to improve the prediction of the dynamics (i.e. changes over time) of the Social and Task dimensions of cohesion. Emotion, here, is addressed in terms of its valence. Both architectures are evaluated against the performances of a similar model that only predicts the dynamics of both the Social and Task dimensions of cohesion, without integrating valence. Statistical analysis shows that only the deep model implementing the Bottom-up approach significantly improved the predictions of the Task cohesion’s dynamics. This result confirms the theoretical and practical benefits of multitasking as it takes full advantage of the inherent relationships between group emotion and cohesion to improve Task cohesion’s predictions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents GAME-ON (Group Analysis of Multimodal Expression of cohesiON), a multimodal dataset specifically designed for studying group cohesion and for explicitly controlling its variation over time. Cohesion is here addressed according to the Severt and Estrada's theoretical multidimensional integrative framework. More specifically, GAME-ON focuses on the social and task dimensions of the instrumental function of cohesion. The dataset consists of over 11 hours of synchronized multimodal recordings (audio, video, and motion capture data) of 17 small groups (3 persons) playing a social game, i.e., an escape game. The game consists of several tasks designed to manipulate the variation of cohesion over time. GAME-ON includes annotations consisting of self-assessment of cohesion and other constructs such as emotions, leadership, and warmth and competence. A first statistical analysis of these annotations shows that we successfully manipulated all the relative variations of cohesion (between tasks) over time. This holds for all tasks except for one where we observed a significant variation of cohesion in the opposite direction than expected. The dataset will be publicly available for research purposes. The motivation of our work is to provide the scientific community with an asset for studying cohesion and other group phenomena.},

 abstract = {Group cohesion is a multidimensional emergent state that manifests during group interaction. It has been extensively studied in several disciplines such as Social Sciences and Computer Science and it has been investigated through both verbal and nonverbal communication. This work investigates the dynamics of task and social dimensions of cohesion through nonverbal motion-capture-based features. We modeled dynamics either as decreasing or as stable/increasing regarding the previous measurement of cohesion. We design and develop a set of features related to space and body movement from motion capture data as it offers reliable and accurate measurements of body motions. Then, we use a random forest model to binary classify (decrease or no decrease) the dynamics of cohesion, for the task and social dimensions. Our model adopts labels from self-assessments of group cohesion, providing a different perspective of study with respect to the previous work relying on third-party labelling. The analysis reveals that, in a multilabel setting, our model is able to predict changes in task and social cohesion with an average accuracy of 64%(±3%) and 67%(±3%), respectively, outperforming random guessing (50%). In a multiclass setting comprised of four classes (i.e., decrease/decrease, decrease/no decrease, no decrease/decrease and no decrease/no decrease), our model also outperforms chance level (25%) for each class (i.e., 54%, 44%, 33%, 50%, respectively). Furthermore, this work provides a method based on notions from cooperative game theory (i.e., SHAP values) to assess features' impact and importance. We identify that the most important features for predicting cohesion dynamics relate to spacial distance, the amount of movement while walking, the overall posture expansion as well as the amount of inter-personal facing in the group.},
